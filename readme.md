Starter
=======

The basic build/setup for typical project types I create.
The `master` branch is plain JS but there are branches for other frameworks/languages.

## Setup

1. `npm install -g elm` - install Elm globally
2. `npm install` - install dependencies

## Development

```
npm start
```

Starts dev server and watchers on source files:

[http://localhost:2112/](http://localhost:2112/)

Use `npm run` to see other available scripts.
